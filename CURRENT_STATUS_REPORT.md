## üîç ANALYSIS

### ‚úÖ CONFIRMED FACTS:
1. **Location timezone is correct:** `America/New_York`
2. **Business hours logic exists:** 8 AM - 8 PM (should block 10 PM)
3. **Current queue is clean:** 0 pending in PostgreSQL for this location
4. **Redis has 2 pending messages:** Will be processed when run_at time arrives

### ‚ö†Ô∏è THE MYSTERY:
**How did messages get scheduled for 10 PM on July 10th?**

**Possible Scenarios:**
1. **Messages were enqueued BEFORE business hours fix**
2. **Bug in business hours logic at that time**
3. **Wrong timezone was used when those messages were enqueued**
4. **Messages were enqueued with run_at already set to 10 PM**

### üîß CURRENT SYSTEM STATUS:
- **PostgreSQL Queue:** 60,890 total messages (massive backlog)
- **Redis:** 140 active streams, processing normally
- **Railway Services:** Both running, processing 1 msg every 3-5 seconds
- **Business Hours Logic:** Should prevent 10 PM scheduling

---

## üéØ NEXT STEPS

1. **Monitor the 2 pending Redis messages** for `fgK4QNPrkW9TsnxdOLjN`
2. **Check if they process during business hours** (8 AM - 8 PM EDT)
3. **Investigate the massive PostgreSQL backlog** (60k messages)
4. **Consider if queue processing speed needs optimization**

## üìã CLEAN SCRIPT STATUS

- Previous queue cleanup script was likely run
- No old SQL files found in directory
- Queue appears to have been cleaned for this specific location
- Massive backlog remains for other locations (especially `brx4IqWlCYpGp3qdLXhZ`)
